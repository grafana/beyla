            **Triggering PR**: #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} — "${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"
            **Repository**: beyla. OBI submodule is in `.obi-src`.

            Your only job is to gather failure information for the next step. Do **not** make code changes or attempt to fix anything.

            1. Use `gh` to list failed workflow runs and checks for this PR. Identify which jobs failed.
            2. For each failing check, get the logs efficiently: use `gh run view` / `gh run download` or equivalent. Logs are large — use **grep**, **tail**, **head** to extract error messages and stack traces. Do not load entire log files into context.
            3. If failing jobs produce artifacts, download them and inspect only what you need (again: grep/tail/head; artifacts often contain large logs — stay efficient).
            4. Write a single file **`triage.md`** in the repository root with:
               - For each failing check: name, workflow/job, and extracted error messages or clues with enough context to understand what went wrong.
               - One short section per failure; keep each section focused.
               - If this PR updates the OBI submodule: note the **old and new OBI commit SHAs** (from the PR branch: e.g. `git diff main -- .obi-src` or submodule pointer in the diff). The next step will use OBI history since the old SHA to guide porting.

            **How to treat failures:**
            - **Timeouts**: Treat CI job timeouts as indicative of an underlying issue. Record them in triage.md with the job name and any log tail (e.g. last activity before timeout) so the next step can investigate. Exception: **RCU CPU stalls** in VM workflows are a known occurrence; note them and label as "RCU CPU stall (VM workflow, known class)" so the plan step can treat them differently if appropriate.
            - **Stuck waits**: Some tests wait for metric or cache expiry. If a job times out or fails because that expiry never happens (test stuck waiting), treat it as a bug: note in triage.md that the test appears to be waiting for expiry that did not occur, so the next step can investigate (e.g. config, timeouts, or broken expiry logic).

            Output: **only** create/update **`triage.md`**. No other file changes. Focus on efficient tool use and minimal turns.

            **Efficiency (stay under ~25 tool calls):** Read **triage.md** first and use it as the main source of truth. Only then open the minimal set of files or run 1–2 git commands (e.g. `git -C .obi-src log OLD..HEAD --oneline`) if triage gives OBI SHAs. Do not explore the repo broadly; do not open large log files, re-run tests, or download CI artifacts. Produce **plan.md** in one focused pass.

            **Inputs:** triage.md (repo root), and only the Beyla / `.obi-src` source files needed to turn triage into a concrete plan.

            **Scope:** Port changes from OBI into Beyla. If triage lists old/new OBI SHAs, use `git -C .obi-src log` / `diff` between those SHAs to see what to port; otherwise infer from triage and a few targeted file reads. Do not plan edits to `internal/testgenerated` (generated); plan script or `scripts/generate-obi-tests.sh` (BEHAVIORAL_TRANSFORMS, CODE_INJECTIONS) or `pkg/beyla/config.go` / Go refactors instead. No test skipping; address failures at the source. Recommend upstream (OBI) changes in the plan if needed; code injections in the test generator are a last resort.

            **Triage rules:** Timeouts → plan a fix (or note RCU CPU stall in VM workflows as known). Stuck metric/cache expiry → plan a fix for expiry or config.

            **Output:** Single file **plan.md** in repo root: (1) short summary of failures, (2) ordered list of concrete changes in Beyla only. No code changes.

            # Implement – fix OBI CI (Beyla only)

            **Triggering PR**: #${{ github.event.pull_request.number }} — "${{ github.event.pull_request.title }}"

            Your only job is to implement the plan and push. Do **not** re-open large log files, re-download CI artifacts, or run the full test suite. Use only:
            - **plan.md** (in repo root) from the previous step
            - If you need extra context: **triage.md** from the first step
            - Source code as needed (including `.obi-src` for reference; inspect OBI history from the submodule dir if the plan refers to porting from new OBI commits).

            **Scope:** Prefer porting changes from OBI into Beyla. The PR branch git diff shows the old and new OBI submodule SHAs; use `git -C .obi-src log OLD_SHA..HEAD` and diffs in `.obi-src` to see what changed in OBI and port the relevant fixes into Beyla.

            **Approach (no test skipping):**
            - **Address failures at the source.** Do not implement test skipping or disabling; fix the underlying cause so tests pass.
            - **Upstream (OBI) changes:** If the plan recommends an upstream fix in OBI, say so in the PR comment and describe what should change in OBI; do not skip tests as a workaround.
            - **Temporary patches:** Code injections in `scripts/generate-obi-tests.sh` (e.g. CODE_INJECTIONS) are a **last resort** only; prefer porting the proper fix from OBI into Beyla.

            Instructions:
            1. Read **plan.md** and implement every item in Beyla only. Do **not** change the OBI submodule (`.obi-src/`).
            2. Do not modify **`internal/testgenerated`** — it is generated; change the script or extensions instead.
            3. After editing, run **`make fmt lint`** (or at least **`make lint`**) as a quick static check.
            4. Commit your changes and push to this PR branch using the commit signing API (no local git push). Post a concise PR comment: what failed, what you changed (file/line if useful), what was committed and pushed, and any recommended upstream (OBI) changes.

            Safety:
            - Read-only git for inspect; use the provided tools to commit and push. Do not force-push or overwrite the submodule commit.
            - Prefer fixes in the Beyla tree that work with the current OBI submodule commit.
