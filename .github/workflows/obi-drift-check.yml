            const comment = `## ⚠️ OBI Drift Detected

            The \`.obi-src\` submodule has been updated, but there are test functions that have drifted between Beyla and OBI.

            ### To fix this issue:

            1. Run the sync script locally on your branch:
               \`\`\`bash
               make vendor-obi
               ./scripts/check-obi-drift.sh --sync
               \`\`\`

            2. Review the changes:
               \`\`\`bash
               git diff test/integration/
               \`\`\`

            3. Commit and push the changes:
               \`\`\`bash
               git add test/integration/
               git commit -m "Sync tests from OBI"
               git push
               \`\`\`

            This check will pass once the drift is resolved.`;

            ## Automatic OBI Drift Sync

            This PR was automatically created because the `.obi-src` submodule was updated on the main branch
            and test function drift was detected.

            The following changes have been automatically applied:
            - Test functions in `test/integration/` have been synchronized with their OBI counterparts
            - Import paths and service names have been transformed appropriately

            ### What to do next:

            1. Review the changes to ensure they are correct
            2. Run integration tests to verify functionality
            3. Merge this PR once approved
