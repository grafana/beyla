              Thank you for your contribution! 
              
              As you're not a repository collaborator, this PR requires a security review because it modifies sensitive files:
              - ${modifiedFiles}
              
              These files can affect the project's build system, CI/CD workflows, or other security-sensitive areas. All workflows have been blocked until a maintainer reviews these changes.
              
              **Note to maintainers:** Please review these changes carefully before approving the PR.`
