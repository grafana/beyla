# Beyla

[![Build Status](https://drone.grafana.net/api/badges/grafana/beyla/status.svg?ref=refs/heads/main)](https://drone.grafana.net/grafana/beyla)

eBPF-based autoinstrumentation of HTTP/HTTPS/GRPC Go services, as well as HTTP/HTTPS services
written in other languages (intercepting Kernel-level socket operations as well as
OpenSSL invocations).

[Documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/TODO).

Requirements:
- Linux with Kernel 4.18 or higher
- eBPF enabled in the host
- For instrumenting Go programs, they must have been compiled with Go 1.17 or higher
- Administrative access to execute the instrumenter
    - Or execute it from a user enabling the `SYS_ADMIN` capability.
- If you want to instrument HTTP calls at kernel-level (for other languages than Go),
  your Kernel needs to enable BTF ([compiled with `CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF`](https://www.baeldung.com/linux/kernel-config))

## How to setup a quick demo

We recommend you to follow our [quickstart tutorial](docs/sources/tutorial/index.md).

Optionally you can just trigger the Kubernetes descriptors in the `deployments/` folder.

1. Provide your Grafana credentials. Use the following [K8s Secret template](deployments/01-grafana-credentials.template.yml)
   to introduce the endpoints, usernames and API keys for Mimir and Tempo:
   ```
   $ cp deployments/01-grafana-credentials.template.yml 01-grafana-credentials.yml
   $ # EDIT the fields
   $ vim 01-grafana-credentials.yml
   $ kubectl apply -f 01-grafana-credentials.yml 
   ```
2. Deploy the Grafana Aent:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f deployments/02-grafana-agent.yml
   ```

3. Deploy a demo app with the auto-instrumenter as a sidecar. You can use the blog example in the
   [deployments/03-instrumented-app.yml](./deployments/03-instrumented-app.yml) file.
   
   ```
   $ kubectl apply -f ./deployments/03-instrumented-app.yml
   $ kubectl port-forward service/goblog 8443:8443
   ```

You should be able to query traces and metrics in your Grafana board.

## Development recipes

### How to regenerate the eBPF Kernel binaries

The eBPF program is embedded into the `pkg/internal/ebpf/bpf_*` generated files.
This step is generally not needed unless you change the C code in the `bpf` folder.

If you have Docker installed, you just need to run:

```
make docker-generate
```

If you can't install docker, you should locally install the following required packages:

```
dnf install -y kernel-devel make llvm clang glibc-devel.i686
make generate
```

Tested in Fedora 35, 38 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
