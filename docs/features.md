# eBPF Autoinstrument value propositions

## Track total request time

When performing a remote service request, the response time that is
perceived by the client is different from the response time that is measured
at the server-side. Often, these values might be really distant.

    section Client-side
        ...code                     :a1, 2014-01-01 00:00, 20ms
        svc request                 :a2, after a1, 1ms
        svc response                :a3, after n2, 1ms
    section Network
        send                        :n1, after a2, 10ms
        rcv                         :n2, after s2, 10ms
    section Server-side (kernel)
        connect/read                :s1, after n1, 10ms
        write/close                 :s2, after u2, 10ms
    section Server-side (user)
        Runtime enqueuing           :u1, after s1, 50ms
        Service handler execution   :u2, after u1, 50ms
```

The above image shows an example; from the start of the service request until the end
of the service response, the client-perceived response time is near to 140 ms.

At the server side, most instrumentation agents are only able to insert probes to measure
the service handler time, which is the part of the code that is written by the service
owner, while the rest of server-side execution time is at the kernel side or at the
language runtime (for example, most languages enqueue incoming HTTP requests for later
dispatch).

Under low-load conditions, most of the execution time will be spent in the service handler,
but in high-load scenarios, many requests might spend a non-negligible time
in an internal queue, waiting to be dispatched. In the above timeline, instrumenting only the
server handler would report metrics measuring that a web request has required 50ms to execute
while in reality it has spent 120ms at the server side. The service owner would get really
inaccurate metrics about their services behavior.

eBPF allows overcoming the limitations of manual instrumentation tools. The eBPF auto-instrument
will insert tracepoints at the kernel connect/receive/write/close functions (also at the
Go runtime in the case of Go applications). This will provide more accurate metrics and
traces, nearer to the user-perceived response time.

Concretely, the eBPF autoinstrument reports traces that are divided in different spans:

    section Server trace
        trace name (e.g. /users/add)    :a1, 2014-01-01 00:00, 100ms
        in queue                        :a2, 2014-01-01 00:00, 50ms
        processing                      :a3, after a2, 50ms
```

The above image shows the typical structure of a trace as reported by the eBPF autoinstrument:

* An overall span measuring the total time spent by the request at the server side.
* A child span measuring the time spent by the request in the queue, waiting to be dispatched.
* A child span, starting where the previous child span ends, measuring the time being spent
  by the actual request handler (the code with business logic, as provided by the application
  developer).
