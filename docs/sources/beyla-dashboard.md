# Beyla RED metrics dashboard

You could start composing your PromQL queries for better visualization of
your auto-instrumented RED metrics; to save you time, we provide a sample
[public dashboard with some basic information](/grafana/dashboards/19923-beyla-red-metrics/).

To import the sample dashboard into your Grafana instance, choose "Dashboards" in the Grafana left panel.
Next, in the Dashboards page, click on the "New" drop-down menu and select "Import":

![Beyla import dashboard](https://grafana.com/media/docs/grafana-cloud/beyla/tutorial/import-dashboard.png)

In the "Import via grafana.com" textbox, copy the Grafana ID from the
[Beyla RED Metrics](/grafana/dashboards/19923-beyla-red-metrics/)
dashboard: `19923`.

Rename the dashboard to match your service, select the folder and, most importantly, select the
data source in the `prometheus-data-source` drop-down at the bottom.

And _voil√†!_ you can see some of your test RED metrics:

The dashboard contains the following components:

- A list with the slowest HTTP routes for all instrumented services. Since you only
  have a single service, only one entry appears. If you configure Beyla to
  [report the HTTP routes]({{< relref "./configure/options.md#routes-decorator" >}}),
  many entries could appear there, one for each HTTP path seen by the server.
- A list with the slowest GRPC methods. Since the test service in this tutorial only
  serves HTTP, this table is empty.
- For each instrumented service, a list of RED metrics for the inbound (server) traffic. This includes:
  - Duration: average and top percentiles for both HTTP and gRPC traffic.
  - Request rate: number of requests per second, faceted by its HTTP or gRPC return code.
  - Error rate as a percentage of 5xx HTTP responses or non-zero gRPC responses over the total
    of the requests. They are faceted by return code.
- For each instrumented service, a list of RED metrics for the outbound (client) traffic. In
  the above screenshot they are empty because the test service does not perform HTTP or gRPC
  calls to other services.
  - The Duration, Request Rate and Errors charts are analogues to the inbound traffic charts,
    with the only difference that 4xx return codes are also considered errors on the
    client side.

At the top of the chart, you can use the "Service" dropdown to filter the services you
want to visualize.
