# Cilium compatibility

[Cilium](https://cilium.io) is an open source cloud native solution for providing, securing, and observing network connectivity between workloads. In some cases the eBPF programs Cilium uses can conflict with the ePBF programs Beyla uses and lead to issues.

Beyla and Cilium use eBPF traffic control classifier programs, `BPF_PROG_TYPE_SCHED_CLS`. These programs attach to the ingress and egress data paths of the kernel networking stack. Together they form a chain of packet filters. Each packet filter is able to inspect the contents of the packet and perform operations, for example redirect or discard the packet.

Beyla programs never disrupt the flow of a packet, but Cilium changes packet flow as part of its operation. If Cilium processes packets before Beyla it can affect its ability to process packets.

## Attachment modes

Beyla uses the Traffic Control eXpress (TCX) API or the Netlink interface in the Linux Kernel to attach traffic control (TC) programs.

The TCX API is in the kernel since version 6.6 and is the preferred method to attach TC programs. It provides a linked list mechanism to attach programs to the head, middle, or tail. Beyla and Cilium auto-detect if the kernel supports TCX and use it by default.

When Beyla and Cilium use TCX they don't interfere with each other. Beyla attaches its eBPF programs to the head of the list and Cilium to the tail. TCX is the preferred operation mode when possible.

The legacy Netlink interface relies on `clsact`, [`qdiscs`](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Traffic-Control-HOWTO/components.html), and a BPF TC filter to attach eBPF programs to network interfaces. The kernel executes filters in order of their priority, with lower numbers having higher priority, and 1 being the highest priority.

When TCX isn't available, both Beyla and Cilium use Netlink interface to install eBPF programs. If Beyla detects Cilium runs programs with priority 1, Beyla exits and displays an error. You can resolve the error by configuring Cilium to use a priority greater than 1.

Beyla also refuses to run if it's configured to use Netlink attachments and it detects Cilium uses TCX.

### Configure Cilium Netlink priority

You can configure Cilium Netlink program priority via the `bpf-filter-priorty` configuration:

```shell
cilium config set bpf-filter-priority 2
```

This ensures that Beyla programs always run before Cilium programs.

### Mixed TCX and Netlink

In the scenario in which the kernel uses both TCX and Netlink attachments, TCX programs run before programs attached via the Netlink interface.

## Beyla attachment mode configuration

Refer to the [configuration documentation](/docs/beyla/latest/configure/options/), to configure Beyla TC attachment mode using the `BEYLA_BPF_TC_BACKEND` configuration option.

You can configure Cilium via its `enable-tcx` boolean configuration option, refer to the [Cilium documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/) for more information.

```shell
cilium config set enable-tcx (true|false)
```

## Beyla and Cilium demo

The following example demonstrates Beyla and Cilium working together to propagate trace context in Kubernetes environments.

### Install Cilium

Install Cilium to a [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) hosted Kubernetes container as outlined in the [Cilium documentation](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/gettingstarted/k8s-install-default/).

If the kernel you deployed Cilium doesn't support TCX, configure Cilium to use priority 2 for its eBPF programs:

```shell
cilium config set bpf-filter-priority 2
```

### Deploy sample services

Use the following definition to deploy the same services. These are small toy services that talk to one another and allow you to see Beyla working with trace-context propagation:

            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /config
              name: beyla-config
            - mountPath: /var/run/beyla
              name: var-run-beyla
          env:
            - name: BEYLA_CONFIG_PATH
              value: "/config/beyla-config.yml"

            name: beyla-config
        - name: var-run-beyla
          emptyDir: {}
```

Forward a port to the host and trigger a request:

```shell
kubectl port-forward services/node-service 30030:30030 &
curl http://localhost:30030/traceme
```

Finally check your Beyla Pod logs:

```shell
for i in `kubectl get pods -n beyla -o name | cut -d '/' -f2`; do kubectl logs -n beyla $i | grep "GET " | sort; done
```

You should see output that shows requests detected by Beyla with trace-context propagation similar to this:
