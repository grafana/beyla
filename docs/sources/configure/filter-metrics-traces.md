# Filter metrics and traces by attribute values

You might want to restrict the reported metrics and traces to very concrete
event types based on the values of the attributes (for example, filter network
metrics to report only TCP traffic).

The `filter` YAML section allows filtering both application and network metrics
by attribute values. It has the following structure:

```yaml
filter:
  application:
    # map of attribute matches to restrict application metrics
  network:
    # map of attribute matches to restrict network metrics
```

For a list of metrics under the application and network family, as well as their
attributes, check the [Beyla exported metrics]({{< relref "../metrics.md" >}}) document.

Each `application` and `network` filter section is a map where each key is an attribute
name (either in Prometheus or OpenTelemetry format), with either the `match` or the `not_match` property. Both properties accept a
[glob-like](https://github.com/gobwas/glob) string (it can be a full value or include
wildcards). If the `match` property is set, Beyla only reports the metrics and traces
matching the provided value for that given attribute. The `not_match` property is the
negation of `match`.

The following example reports network metrics for connections targeting the destination port 53, excluding the UDP protocol:

```yaml
filter:
  network:
    transport:
      not_match: UDP
    dst_port:
      match: "53"
```
