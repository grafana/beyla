# Beyla configuration options

Beyla can be configured via environment variables or via
a YAML configuration file that is passed either with the `-config` command-line
argument or the `BEYLA_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable.
Environment variables have priority over the properties in the
configuration file. For example, in the following command line, the BEYLA_OPEN_PORT option,
is used to override any open_port settings inside the config.yaml file:

```
$ BEYLA_OPEN_PORT=8080 beyla -config /path/to/config.yaml
```

or

```
$ BEYLA_OPEN_PORT=8080 BEYLA_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/config.yaml beyla
```

At the end of this document, there is an [example of YAML configuration file](#yaml-file-example).

Currently, Beyla consist of a pipeline of components which
generate, transform, and export traces from HTTP and GRPC applications. In the
YAML configuration, each component has its own first-level section.

Optionally, Beyla also provides network-level metrics, which are documented in the
[Network metrics section of the Beyla documentation]({{< relref "../network" >}}).

A quick description of the components:

- [Service discovery](#service-discovery) searches for instrumentable processes matching
  a given criteria.
- [EBPF tracer](#ebpf-tracer) instruments the HTTP and GRPC services of an external process,
  creates service traces and forwards them to the next stage of the pipeline.
- [Configuration of metrics and traces attributes](#configuration-of-metrics-and-traces-attributes) to control
  which attributes are reported.
- [Routes decorator](#routes-decorator) will match HTTP paths (e.g. `/user/1234/info`)
  into user-provided HTTP routes (e.g. `/user/{id}/info`). If no routes are defined,
  the incoming data will be directly forwarded to the next stage.
- [Kubernetes decorator](#kubernetes-decorator) will decorate the metrics and traces
  with Kubernetes metadata of the instrumented Pods.
- [Filter metrics and traces by attribute values](#filter-metrics-and-traces-by-attribute-values).
- [Grafana Cloud OTEL exporter for metrics and traces](#using-the-grafana-cloud-otel-endpoint-to-ingest-metrics-and-traces)
  simplifies the submission of OpenTelemetry metrics and traces to Grafana cloud.
- [OTEL metrics exporter](#otel-metrics-exporter) exports metrics data to an external
  [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) metrics collector.
- [OTEL traces exporter](#otel-traces-exporter) exports span data to an external
  [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) traces collector.
- [Prometheus HTTP endpoint](#prometheus-http-endpoint) enables an HTTP endpoint
  that allows any external scraper to pull metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) format.
- [Internal metrics reporter](#internal-metrics-reporter) optionally reports metrics about the internal behavior of
  the auto-instrumentation tool in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) format.

The following sections explain the global configuration properties, as well as
the options for each component.

## Global configuration properties

The properties in this section are first-level YAML properties, as they apply to the
whole Beyla configuration:

| YAML              | Environment variable                 | Type   | Default |
| ----------------- | ----------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `executable_name` | `BEYLA_EXECUTABLE_NAME` | string | (unset) |

Selects the process to instrument by the executable name path. This property accepts
a regular expression to be matched against the full executable command line, including the directory
where the executable resides on the file system.

This property is used to select a single process to instrument, or a group of processes of
similar characteristics. For more fine-grained process selection and grouping, you can
follow the instructions in the [service discovery section](#service-discovery).

If the `open_port` property is set, the executable to be selected needs to match both properties.

When instrumenting by using the executable name, choose a non-ambiguous name, a name that
will match a single executable on the target system.
For example, if you set `BEYLA_EXECUTABLE_NAME=server`, and you have running two processes whose executables
have the following paths:

```sh
/usr/local/bin/language-server
/opt/app/server
```

Beyla will match indistinctly one of the above processes and instrument both.
If you just want to instrument one of them, you should be as concrete as possible about
the value of the setting. For example, `BEYLA_EXECUTABLE_NAME=/opt/app/server`
or just `BEYLA_EXECUTABLE_NAME=/server`.

| YAML        | Environment variable           | Type   | Default |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `open_port` | `BEYLA_OPEN_PORT` | string | (unset) |

Selects the process to instrument by the port it has open (listens to). This property
accepts a comma-separated list of ports (for example, `80`), and port ranges (for example, `8000-8999`).
If the executable matching only one of the ports in the list, it is considered to match
the selection criteria.

For example, specifying the following property:

```
open_port: 80,443,8000-8999
```

Would make Beyla to select any executable that opens port 80, 443, or any of the ports between 8000 and 8999 included.

This property is used to select a single process to instrument, or a group of processes of
similar characteristics. For more fine-grained process selection and grouping, you can
follow the instructions in the [service discovery section](#service-discovery).

If the `executable_name` property is set, the executable to be selected needs to match both properties.

If an executable opens multiple ports, only one of the ports needs to be specified
for Beyla **to instrument all the
HTTP/S and GRPC requests on all application ports**. At the moment, there is no way to
restrict the instrumentation only to the methods exposed through a specific port.

If the specified port range is wide (e.g. `1-65535`) Beyla will try to execute all the processes
owning one of the ports in the range.

| YAML           | Environment variable                                     | Type   | Default                                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `service_name` | `BEYLA_SERVICE_NAME` or `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | string | (see [service discovery](#service-discovery) section) |

Overrides the name of the instrumented service to be reported by the metrics exporter.
Defining this property is equivalent to add a `name` entry into the [`discovery.services` YAML
section](#service-discovery).

If a single instance of Beyla is instrumenting multiple instances of different processes,
they will share the same service name even if they are different. If you need that a
single instance of Beyla report different service names, follow the instructions in the
[service discovery section](#service-discovery).

| YAML                | Environment variable                   | Type   | Default                                               |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `service_namespace` | `BEYLA_SERVICE_NAMESPACE` | string | (see [service discovery](#service-discovery) section) |

Optionally, allows assigning a namespace for the service selected from the `executable_name`
or `open_port` properties.

Defining this property is equivalent to add a `name` entry into the [`discovery.services` YAML
section](#service-discovery).

This will assume a single namespace for all the services instrumented
by Beyla. If you need that a single instance of Beyla groups multiple services
into different namespaces, follow the instructions in the
[service discovery section](#service-discovery).

It is important to notice that this namespace is not a selector for Kubernetes namespaces. Its
value will be use to set the value of standard telemetry attributes. For example, the
[OpenTelemetry `service.namespace` attribute](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/common/attribute-naming/).

| YAML        | Environment variable           | Type   | Default |
| ----------- | ----------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `log_level` | `BEYLA_LOG_LEVEL` | string | `INFO`  |

Sets the verbosity level of the process standard output logger.
Valid log level values are: `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN` and `ERROR`.
`DEBUG` being the most verbose and `ERROR` the least verbose.

| YAML           | Environment variable              | Type    | Default |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `print_traces` | `BEYLA_PRINT_TRACES` | boolean | `false` |

<a id="printer"></a>

If `true`, prints any instrumented trace on the standard output (stdout).

## Service discovery

The `executable_name`, `open_port`, `service_name` and `service_namespace` are top-level
properties that simplify the configuration of Beyla to instrument a single service, or
a group of related services.

In some scenarios, Beyla will instrument a big variety of services; for example,
as a [Kubernetes DaemonSet]({{< relref "../setup/kubernetes.md" >}}) that instruments all
the services in a node. The `discovery` YAML section will let you specify a higher
differentiation degree in the services that Beyla can instrument.

For example, it will allow overriding the service name and namespace per service type.

| YAML       | Environment variable | Type            | Default |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------- | ------- |
| `services` | N/A     | list of objects | (unset) |

This section allows specifying different selection criteria for different services,
as well as overriding some of their metadata, such as their reported name or
namespace.

For more details about this section, go to the [discovery services section](#discovery-services-section)
of this document.

| YAML                       | Environment variable                          | Type    | Default |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `skip_go_specific_tracers` | `BEYLA_SKIP_GO_SPECIFIC_TRACERS` | boolean | false   |

Disables the detection of Go specifics when ebpf tracer inspects executables to be instrumented.
The tracer will fallback to using generic instrumentation, which will generally be less efficient.

### Discovery services section

Example of YAML file allowing the selection of multiple groups of services:

```yaml
discovery:
  services:
    - exe_path: (worker)|(backend)|(frontend)
      namespace: MyApplication
    - exe_path: loadgen
      namespace: testing
      name: "TestLoadGenerator"
```

The above example YAML will select two groups of executables. The first group will be formed by any
process whose executable path contains the `worker`, `backend` or `frontend` text. For each
service, Beyla will take the service name attribute from the executable name. The reported
service namespace for all the processes matching this group will be `MyApplication`.

The second group in the above example YAML will select any executable whose path contains
`regexp`, but instead of taking the service name from the executable name, it will override
the service name with `TestLoadGenerator`.

The rest of this section describes the properties that are accepted in each entry of the
`services` list.

Each `services` entry is a map where the properties can be grouped according to two purposes:

- Overriding the reported service name and namespace: `name` and `namespace` properties.
- Selecting the process to instrument: the rest of the properties, referred as _selectors_ in
  this documentation.

| YAML   | Environment variable | Type   | Default           |
| ------ | ------- | ------ | ----------------- |
| `name` | --      | string | (see description) |

Defines a name for the matching instrumented service. It will be used to populate the `service.name`
OTEL property and/or the `service_name` prometheus property in the exported metrics/traces.

If the property is not set, it will default to any of the following properties, in order of
precedence:

- If Kubernetes is enabled:
  1. The name of the Deployment that runs the instrumented process, if any.
  2. The name of the ReplicaSet that runs the instrumented process, if any.
  3. The name of the Pod that runs the instrumented process.
- If kubernetes is not enabled:
  1. The name of the process executable file.

If multiple processes match the service selection criteria described below,
the metrics and traces for all the instances might share the same service name;
for example, when multiple instrumented processes run under the same Deployment,
or have the same executable name. In that case, the reported `instance.id` (OTEL) or
`target_instance` (Prometheus) would allow differentiating the different instances
of the service.

| YAML        | Environment variable | Type   | Default                  |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| `namespace` | --      | string | (empty or K8s namespace) |

Defines a namespace for the matching instrumented service.
If the property is not set, it will be defaulted to the Kubernetes namespace of
that runs the instrumented process, if Kubernetes is available, or empty when
Kubernetes is not available.

It is important to notice that this namespace is not a selector for Kubernetes namespaces. Its
value will be use to set the value of standard telemetry attributes. For example, the
[OpenTelemetry `service.namespace` attribute](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/common/attribute-naming/).

| YAML         | Environment variable | Type   | Default |
| ------------ | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| `open_ports` | --      | string | (unset) |

Selects the process to instrument by the port it has open (listens to). This property
accepts a comma-separated list of ports (for example, `80`), and port ranges (for example, `8000-8999`).
If the executable matching only one of the ports in the list, it is considered to match
the selection criteria.

For example, specifying the following property:

```
open_port: 80,443,8000-8999
```

Would make Beyla to select any executable that opens port 80, 443, or any of the ports between 8000 and 8999 included.

If other selectors are specified in the same `services` entry, the processes to be
selected need to match all the selector properties.

If an executable opens multiple ports, only one of the ports needs to be specified
for Beyla **to instrument all the
HTTP/S and GRPC requests on all application ports**. At the moment, there is no way to
restrict the instrumentation only to the methods exposed through a specific port.

| YAML       | Environment variable | Type                        | Default |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `exe_path` | --      | string (regular expression) | (unset) |

Selects the processes to instrument by their executable name path. This property accepts
a regular expression to be matched against the full executable command line, including the directory
where the executable resides on the file system.

Beyla will try to instrument all the processes with an executable path matching this property.
For example, setting `exe_path: .*` will make Beyla to try to instrument all the
executables in the host.

If other selectors are specified in the same `services` entry, the processes to be
selected need to match all the selector properties.

| YAML            | Environment variable | Type                        | Default |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `k8s_namespace` | --      | string (regular expression) | (unset) |

This selector property will limit the instrumentation to the applications
running in the Kubernetes Namespaces with a name matching the provided regular
expression.

If other selectors are specified in the same `services` entry, the processes to be
selected need to match all the selector properties.

| YAML           | Environment variable | Type                        | Default |
| -------------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `k8s_pod_name` | --      | string (regular expression) | (unset) |

This selector property will limit the instrumentation to the applications
running in the Kubernetes Pods with a name matching the provided regular
expression.

If other selectors are specified in the same `services` entry, the processes to be
selected need to match all the selector properties.

| YAML                  | Environment variable | Type                        | Default |
| --------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `k8s_deployment_name` | --      | string (regular expression) | (unset) |

This selector property will limit the instrumentation to the applications
running in the Kubernetes Deployments with a name matching the provided regular
expression.

If other selectors are specified in the same `services` entry, the processes to be
selected need to match all the selector properties.

| YAML                  | Environment variable | Type                        | Default |
| --------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `k8s_replicaset_name` | --      | string (regular expression) | (unset) |

This selector property will limit the instrumentation to the applications
running in the Kubernetes ReplicaSets with a name matching the provided regular
expression.

If other selectors are specified in the same `services` entry, the processes to be
selected need to match all the selector properties.

| YAML                   | Environment variable | Type                        | Default |
| ---------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `k8s_statefulset_name` | --      | string (regular expression) | (unset) |

This selector property will limit the instrumentation to the applications
running in the Kubernetes StatefulSets with a name matching the provided regular
expression.

If other selectors are specified in the same `services` entry, the processes to be
selected need to match all the selector properties.

| YAML                 | Environment variable | Type                        | Default |
| -------------------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `k8s_daemonset_name` | --      | string (regular expression) | (unset) |

This selector property will limit the instrumentation to the applications
running in the Kubernetes DaemonSet with a name matching the provided regular
expression.

If other selectors are specified in the same `services` entry, the processes to be
selected need to match all the selector properties.

| YAML             | Environment variable | Type                        | Default |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `k8s_owner_name` | --      | string (regular expression) | (unset) |

This selector property will limit the instrumentation to the applications
running in the Pods having owned by either a `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet`,
`DaemonSet` or `StatefulSet` with a name matching the provided regular
expression.

If other selectors are specified in the same `services` entry, the processes to be
selected need to match all the selector properties.

| YAML             | Environment variable | Type                        | Default |
| ---------------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ------- |
| `k8s_pod_labels` | --      | map\[string\]string (regular expression) | (unset) |

This selector property limits the instrumentation to the applications
running in the Pods having labels with keys matching the provided value as regular expression.

If other selectors are specified in the same `services` entry, the processes to be
selected need to match all the selector properties.

For example:

```yaml
discovery:
  services:
    - k8s_namespace: frontend
      k8s_pod_labels:
        instrument: beyla
```

The preceding example discovers all Pods in the `frontend` namespace that have a label
`instrument` with a value that matches the regular expression `beyla`.

## EBPF tracer

YAML section `ebpf`.

| YAML         | Environment variable   | Type   | Default |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `wakeup_len` | `BEYLA_BPF_WAKEUP_LEN` | string | (unset) |

Specifies how many messages need to be accumulated in the eBPF ringbuffer
before sending a wake-up request to the user space code.

In high-load services (in terms of requests/second), tuning this option to higher values
can help with reducing the CPU overhead of Beyla.

In low-load services (in terms of requests/second), high values of `wakeup_len` could
add a noticeable delay in the time the metrics are submitted and become externally visible.

| YAML                    | Environment variable              | Type    | Default |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `track_request_headers` | `BEYLA_BPF_TRACK_REQUEST_HEADERS` | boolean | (false) |

Enables tracking of request headers for the purposes of processing any incoming 'Traceparent'
header values. If this option is enabled, when Beyla encounters an incoming server request with
a 'Traceparent' header value, it will use the provided 'trace id' to create its own trace spans.

This option does not have an effect on Go applications, where the 'Traceparent' field is always
processed, without additional tracking of the request headers.

Enabling this option may increase the performance overhead in high request volume scenarios.
This option is only useful when generating Beyla traces, it does not affect
generation of Beyla metrics.

| YAML                    | Environment variable               | Type    | Default |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `http_request_timeout`  | `BEYLA_BPF_HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`   | string  | (30s)   |

Configures the time interval after which an HTTP request is considered as a timeout.
This option allows Beyla to report HTTP transactions which timeout and never return.
To disable the automatic HTTP request timeout feature, set this option to zero, i.e. "0ms".

## Configuration of metrics and traces attributes

Grafana Beyla allows configuring how some attributes for metrics and traces
are decorated. Under the `attributes` top YAML sections, you can enable
other subsections configure how some attributes are set.

### Selection of metric attributes

The [Beyla exported metrics]({{< relref "../metrics.md" >}}) document lists the attributes
that can be reported with each metric. Some of the attributes are reported by default while
others are hidden to control the cardinality.

For each metric, you can control which attributes to see with the `select` subsection, which
is a map where each key is the name of a metric (either in its OpenTelemetry or Prometheus port),
and each metric has two more sub-properties: `include` and `exclude`.

* `include` is a list of attributes that need to be reported. Each attribute can be an attribute
  name or a wildcard (for example, `k8s.dst.*` to include all the attributes starting with `k8s.dst`).
  If no `include` list is provided, the default attribute set is reported (check [Beyla exported metrics]({{< relref "../metrics.md" >}})
  for more information about the default attributes for a given metric).
* `exclude` is a list to of attribute names/wildcards containing the attributes to remove from the
  `include` list (or the default attribute set).

Example:
```yaml
attributes:
  select:
    beyla_network_flow_bytes:
      # limit the beyla_network_flow_bytes attributes to only the three attributes
      include:
        - beyla.ip
        - src.name
        - dst.port
    sql_client_duration:
      # report all the possible attributes but db_statement
      include: ["*"]
      exclude: ["db_statement"]
    http_client_request_duration:
      # report the default attribute set but exclude the Kubernetes Pod information
      exclude: ["k8s.pod.*"]
```

### Instance ID decoration

The metrics and the traces are decorated with a unique instance ID string, identifying
each instrumented application. By default, Beyla uses the host name that runs Beyla
(can be a container or Pod name), followed by the PID of the instrumented process;
but you can override how the instance ID is composed in the
`instance_id` YAML subsection under the `attributes` top-level section.

For example:

```yaml
attributes:
  instance_id:
    dns: false
```

| YAML  | Environment variable                         | Type    | Default |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `dns` | `BEYLA_HOSTNAME_DNS_RESOLUTION` | boolean | `true`  |

If `true`, it will try to resolve the Beyla local hostname against the network DNS.
If `false`, it will use the local hostname.

| YAML                | Environment variable          | Type   | Default |
| ------------------- | ---------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `override_hostname` | `BEYLA_HOSTNAME` | string | (unset) |

If set, the host part of the Instance ID will use the provided string
instead of trying to automatically resolve the host name.

This option takes precedence over `dns`.

| YAML                   | Environment variable             | Type   | Default |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `override_instance_id` | `BEYLA_INSTANCE_ID` | string | (unset) |

If set, Beyla will use this value directly as instance ID of any instrumented
process. If you are managing multiple processes from a single Beyla instance,
all the processes will have the same instance ID.

### Kubernetes decorator

If you run Beyla in a Kubernetes environment, you can configure it to decorate the traces
and metrics with the Standard OpenTelemetry labels:

- `k8s.namespace.name`
- `k8s.deployment.name`
- `k8s.statefulset.name`
- `k8s.replicaset.name`
- `k8s.daemonset.name`
- `k8s.node.name`
- `k8s.pod.name`
- `k8s.pod.uid`
- `k8s.pod.start_time`

In YAML, this section is named `kubernetes`, and is located under the
`attributes` top-level section. For example:

```yaml
attributes:
  kubernetes:
    enable: true
```

It is IMPORTANT to consider that enabling this feature requires a previous step of
providing some extra permissions to the Beyla Pod. Consult the
["Configuring Kubernetes metadata decoration section" in the "Running Beyla in Kubernetes"]({{< relref "../setup/kubernetes.md" >}}) page.

| YAML     | Environment variable                      | Type    | Default |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| `enable` | `BEYLA_KUBE_METADATA_ENABLE` | boolean | `false` |

If set to `true`, Beyla will decorate the metrics and traces with Kubernetes metadata.

If set to `false`, the Kubernetes metadata decorator will be disabled.

If set to `autodetect`, Beyla will try to automatically detect if it is running inside
Kubernetes, and enable the metadata decoration if that is the case.

| YAML              | Environment variable      | Type   | Default          |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------ | ---------------- |
| `kubeconfig_path` | `KUBECONFIG` | string | `~/.kube/config` |

This is a standard Kubernetes configuration environment variable, and is used
to tell Beyla where to find the Kubernetes configuration in order to try to
establish communication with the Kubernetes Cluster.

Usually you won't need to change this value.

## Routes decorator

YAML section `routes`.

This section can be only configured via the YAML file. If no `routes` section is provided in
the YAML file, a default routes' pipeline stage will be created and filtered with the `wildcard`
routes decorator.

| YAML       | Environment variable | Type            | Default |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------- | ------- |
| `patterns` | --      | list of strings | (unset) |

Will match the provided URL path patterns and set the `http.route` trace/metric
property accordingly. You should use the `routes` property
whenever possible to reduce the cardinality of generated metrics.

Each route pattern is a URL path with specific tags which allow for grouping path
segments. The matcher tags can be in the `:name` or `{name}` format.

For example, if you define the following patterns:

```yaml
routes:
  patterns:
    - /user/{id}
    - /user/{id}/basket/{product}
```

Traces with the following HTTP paths will include the same `http.route='/user/{id}'` property:

```
/user/123
/user/456
```

Traces with the following HTTP paths will include the same `http.route='/user/{id}'/basket/{product}`
property:

```
/user/123/basket/1
/user/456/basket/3
```

Additionally, the route matcher also supports the wildcard character `*`, which can be used to
match path prefixes. For example, if you define the following pattern:

```yaml
routes:
  patterns:
    - /user/*
```

Any traces with HTTP paths starting with `/user` (including `/user` itself) will be matched to the
route `/user/*`. As per the example above, all of the following paths will be matched as `/user/*`:

```
/user
/user/123
/user/123/basket/1
/user/456/basket/3
```

| YAML               | Environment variable | Type            | Default |
| ------------------ | ------- | --------------- | ------- |
| `ignored_patterns` | --      | list of strings | (unset) |

Will match the provided URL path against the defined patterns, and discard the trace and/or metric events if
they match any of the `ignored_patterns`. The format for the `ignored_patterns` field is identical
to the `patterns` field described above. You can define the ignored patterns with or without
any of the wildcard options. For example, if you define the following ignored patterns:

```yaml
routes:
  ignored_patterns:
    - /health
    - /v1/*
```

Any event paths which have a prefix of `/v1` or are equal to `/health` will be ignored.

This option is very useful if you want to prevent certain paths used development or service health monitoring, to be
recorded as traces or metrics.

| YAML          | Environment variable | Type   | Default |
| ------------- | ------- | ------ | ------- |
| `ignore_mode` | --      | string | `all`   |

This property can be used together with the `ignored_patterns` property to refine which type of events are ignored.

Possible values for the `ignore_mode` property are:

- `all` will discard both **metrics** and **traces** which match the `ignored_patterns`.
- `traces` will discard only the **traces** which match the `ignored_patterns`. No metric events will be ignored.
- `metrics` will discard only the **metrics** which match the `ignored_patterns`. No trace events will be ignored.

Selectively ignoring only certain type of events might be useful in certain scenarios. For example, you may want to
know the performance metrics of your health check API, but you wouldn't want the overhead of those trace records in
your target traces database. In this example scenario, you would set the `ignore_mode` property to `traces`, such
that only traces matching the `ignored_patterns` will be discarded, while metrics will still be recorded.

| YAML        | Environment variable | Type   | Default    |
| ----------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- |
| `unmatched` | --      | string | `wildcard` |

Specifies what to do when a trace HTTP path does not match any of the `patterns` entries.

Possible values for the `unmatched` property are:

- `unset` will leave the `http.route` property as unset.
- `path` will copy the `http.route` field property to the path value.
  - 🚨 Caution: this option could lead to cardinality explosion at the ingester side.
- `wildcard` will set the `http.route` field property to a generic asterisk based `/**` value.
- `heuristic` will automatically derive the `http.route` field property from the path value, based on the following rules:
  - Any path components which have numbers or characters outside of the ASCII alphabet (or `-` and `_`), will be replaced by an asterisk `*`.
  - Any alphabetical components which don't look like words, will be replaced by an asterisk `*`.

### Special considerations when using the `heuristic` route decorator mode

The `heuristic` decorator is a best effort route decorator, which may still lead to cardinality explosion in certain scenarios.
For example, the GitHub URL paths are a good example where the `heuristic` route decorator will not work, since the URL paths
are constructed like a directory tree. In this scenario all paths will remain unique and lead to cardinality explosion.

On the other hand, if your URL path patterns follow certain structure, and the unique IDs are made up of numbers or random characters,
then the `heuristic` decorator may be a low effort configuration option which is suitable for your use-case. For example, the following
mock Google Docs URLs will be correctly reduced to a low cardinality version:

Both URL paths below:

```
document/d/CfMkAGbE_aivhFydEpaRafPuGWbmHfG/edit (no numbers in the ID)
document/d/C2fMkAGb3E_aivhFyd5EpaRafP123uGWbmHfG/edit
```

will be converted to a low cardinality route:

```
document/d/*/edit
```

## OTEL metrics exporter

> ℹ️ If you plan to use Beyla to send metrics to Grafana Cloud,
> consult the [Grafana Cloud OTEL exporter for metrics and traces](#using-the-grafana-cloud-otel-endpoint-to-ingest-metrics-and-traces)
> section for easier configuration.

YAML section `otel_metrics_export`.

This component exports OpenTelemetry metrics to a given endpoint. It will be enabled if
its `endpoint` attribute is set (either via an YAML configuration file or via environment variables).

In addition to the properties exposed in this section, this component implicitly supports
the environment variables from the [standard OTEL exporter configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter-configuration/).

| YAML       | Environment variable                                                                    | Type | Default |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| `endpoint` | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` or<br/>`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` | URL  | (unset) |

Specifies the OpenTelemetry endpoint where metrics will be sent. If you plan to send the
metrics directly to the Grafana Cloud OpenTelemetry endpoint, you might prefer to use the
configuration options in the
[Using the Grafana Cloud OTEL endpoint to ingest metrics and traces](#using-the-grafana-cloud-otel-endpoint-to-ingest-metrics-and-traces)
section.

The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable sets a common endpoint for both the metrics and the
[traces](#otel-traces-exporter) exporters. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` environment variable,
or the `endpoint` YAML, property will set the endpoint only for the metrics exporter node,
such that the traces' exporter won't be activated unless explicitly specified.

According to the OpenTelemetry standard, if you set the endpoint via the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable,
the OpenTelemetry exporter will automatically add the `/v1/metrics` path to the URL. If you want to avoid this
addition, you can use either the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT` environment variable or the `environment` YAML
property to use exactly the provided URL without any addition.

| YAML       | Environment variable                                                                    | Type   | Default   |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| `protocol` | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` or<br/>`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_PROTOCOL` | string | (guessed) |

Specifies the transport/encoding protocol of the OpenTelemetry endpoint.

The accepted values, as defined by the [OTLP Exporter Configuration document](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter-configuration/#otel_exporter_otlp_protocol) are `http/json`, `http/protobuf` and `grpc`.

The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` environment variable sets a common protocol for both the metrics and
[traces](#otel-traces-exporter) exporters. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_PROTOCOL` environment variable,
or the `protocol` YAML property, will set the protocol only for the metrics exporter node.

If this property is not provided, Beyla will guess it according to the following rules:

- Beyla will guess `grpc` if the port ends in `4317` (`4317`, `14317`, `24317`, ...),
  as `4317` is the usual Port number for the OTEL GRPC collector.
- Beyla will guess `http/protobuf` if the port ends in `4318` (`4318`, `14318`, `24318`, ...),
  as `4318` is the usual Port number for the OTEL HTTP collector.

| YAML                   | Environment variable                           | Type | Default |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| `insecure_skip_verify` | `BEYLA_OTEL_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` | bool | `false` |

Controls whether the OTEL client verifies the server's certificate chain and host name.
If set to `true`, the OTEL client accepts any certificate presented by the server
and any host name in that certificate. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle
attacks. This option should be used only for testing and development purposes.

| YAML       | Environment variable                  | Type     | Default |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | -------- | ------- |
| `interval` | `BEYLA_METRICS_INTERVAL` | Duration | `5s`    |

Configures the intervening time between exports.


| YAML  | Environment variable     | Type     | Default |
|-------|--------------------------|----------|---------|
| `ttl` | `BEYLA_OTEL_METRICS_TTL` | Duration | `5m`    |

The group of attributes for a metric instance is not reported anymore if the time since
the last update is greater than this Time-To-Leave (TTL) value.

The purpose of this value is to avoid reporting indefinitely finished application instances.

| YAML       | Environment variable          | Type            | Default                      |
|------------|-------------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| `features` | `BEYLA_OTEL_METRICS_FEATURES` | list of strings | `["application", "network"]` |

A list of metric groups that are allowed to be exported. Each group belongs to a different feature
of Beyla: application-level metrics or network metrics.

- If the list contains `application`, the Beyla OpenTelemetry exporter exports application-level metrics;
  but only if there is defined an OpenTelemetry endpoint, and Beyla was able to discover any
  process matching the entries in the `discovery` section.
- If the list contains `application_span`, the Beyla OpenTelemetry exporter exports application-level trace span metrics;
  but only if there is defined an OpenTelemetry endpoint, and Beyla was able to discover any
  process matching the entries in the `discovery` section. 
- If the list contains `application_service_graph`, the Beyla OpenTelemetry exporter exports application-level service graph metrics;
  but only if there is defined an OpenTelemetry endpoint, and Beyla was able to discover any
  process matching the entries in the `discovery` section. 
  For best experience with generating service graph metrics, use a DNS for service discovery and make sure the DNS names match
  the OpenTelemetry service names used in Beyla. In Kubernetes environments, the OpenTelemetry service name set by the service name
  discovery is the best choice for service graph metrics.
- If the list contains `network`, the Beyla OpenTelemetry exporter exports network-level
  metrics; but only if there is defined an OpenTelemetry endpoint and the
  [network metrics are enabled]({{< relref "../network" >}}).

Usually you do not need to change this configuration option, unless, for example, a Beyla instance
instruments both network and applications, and you want to disable application-level metrics because
you only care about application traces, but still want Beyla to send network metrics.

| YAML      | Environment variable | Type   |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| `buckets` | (n/a)   | Object |

The `buckets` object allows overriding the bucket boundaries of diverse histograms. See
[Overriding histogram buckets](#overriding-histogram-buckets) section for more details.

| YAML                    | Environment variable                                       | Type     | Default                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------|-----------------------------|
| `histogram_aggregation` | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_DEFAULT_HISTOGRAM_AGGREGATION` | `string` | `explicit_bucket_histogram` |

Specifies the default aggregation to use for histogram instruments.

Accepted values are:

* `explicit_bucket_histogram` (default): use [Explicit Bucket Histogram Aggregation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/sdk/#explicit-bucket-histogram-aggregation).
* `base2_exponential_bucket_histogram`: use [Base2 Exponential Bucket Histogram Aggregation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/sdk/#base2-exponential-bucket-histogram-aggregation).

### Overriding histogram buckets

For both OpenTelemetry and Prometheus metrics exporters, you can override the histogram bucket
boundaries via a configuration file (see `buckets` YAML section of your metrics exporter configuration).

| YAML                 | Type        |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| `duration_histogram` | `[]float64` |

Sets the bucket boundaries for the metrics related to the request duration. Specifically:

- `http.server.request.duration` (OTEL) / `http_server_request_duration_seconds` (Prometheus)
- `http.client.request.duration` (OTEL) / `http_client_request_duration_seconds` (Prometheus)
- `rpc.server.duration` (OTEL) / `rpc_server_duration_seconds` (Prometheus)
- `rpc.client.duration` (OTEL) / `rpc_client_duration_seconds` (Prometheus)

If the value is unset, the default bucket boundaries follow the
[recommendation from the OpenTelemetry semantic conventions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/metrics/semantic_conventions/http-metrics.md)

```
0, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10
```

| YAML                     | Type        |
| ------------------------ | ----------- |
| `request_size_histogram` | `[]float64` |

Sets the bucket boundaries for the metrics related to request sizes. This is:

- `http.server.request.body.size` (OTEL) / `http_server_request_body_size_bytes` (Prometheus)
- `http.client.request.body.size` (OTEL) / `http_client_request_body_size_bytes` (Prometheus)

If the value is unset, the default bucket boundaries are:

```
0, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192
```

The default values are UNSTABLE and could change if Prometheus or OpenTelemetry semantic
conventions recommend a different set of bucket boundaries.

### Use native histograms and exponential histograms

For Prometheus, [native histograms](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/#histogram) are enabled if you
[enable the `native-histograms` feature in your Prometheus collector](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/feature_flags/#native-histograms).

For OpenTelemetry you can use [exponential histograms](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/data-model/#exponentialhistogram)
for the predefined histograms instead of defining the buckets manually. You need to set up the standard
[OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_DEFAULT_HISTOGRAM_AGGREGATION](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/metrics/sdk_exporters/otlp/#additional-configuration)
environment variable. See the `histogram_aggregation` section in the [OTEL metrics exporter](#otel-metrics-exporter) section
for more information.

## OTEL traces exporter

> ℹ️ If you plan to use Beyla to send metrics to Grafana Cloud,
> consult the [Grafana Cloud OTEL exporter for metrics and traces](#using-the-grafana-cloud-otel-endpoint-to-ingest-metrics-and-traces)
> section for easier configuration.

YAML section `otel_traces_export`.

This component exports OpenTelemetry traces to a given endpoint. It will be enabled if
its `endpoint` attribute is set (either via an YAML configuration file or via environment variables).

In addition to the properties exposed in this section, this component implicitly supports
the environment variables from the [standard OTEL exporter configuration](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter-configuration/).

| YAML       | Environment variable                                                                   | Type | Default |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| `endpoint` | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` or<br/>`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` | URL  | (unset) |

Specifies the OpenTelemetry endpoint where the traces will be sent. If you plan to send the
metrics directly to the Grafana Cloud OpenTelemetry endpoint, you might prefer to use the
configuration options in the
[Using the Grafana Cloud OTEL endpoint to ingest metrics and traces](#using-the-grafana-cloud-otel-endpoint-to-ingest-metrics-and-traces)
section.

The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable sets a common endpoint for both the
[metrics](#otel-metrics-exporter) and the traces exporters. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` environment variable
or the `endpoint` YAML property, will set the endpoint only for the traces' exporter node,
so the metrics exporter won't be activated unless explicitly specified.

According to the OpenTelemetry standard, if you set the endpoint via the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` environment variable,
the OpenTelemetry exporter will automatically add the `/v1/traces` path to the URL. If you want to avoid this
addition, you can use either the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` environment variable or the `environment` YAML
property to use exactly the provided URL without any addition.

| YAML       | Environment variable                                                                   | Type   | Default   |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| `protocol` | `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` or<br/>`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL` | string | (guessed) |

Specifies the transport/encoding protocol of the OpenTelemetry traces endpoint.

The accepted values, as defined by the [OTLP Exporter Configuration document](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/otlp-exporter-configuration/#otel_exporter_otlp_protocol) are `http/json`, `http/protobuf` and `grpc`.

The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` environment variable sets a common protocol for both the metrics and
the [traces](#otel-traces-exporter) exporters. The `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_PROTOCOL` environment variable,
or the `protocol` YAML property, will set the protocol only for the traces' exporter node.

If this property is not provided, Beyla will guess it according to the following rules:

- Beyla will guess `grpc` if the port ends in `4317` (`4317`, `14317`, `24317`, ...),
  as `4317` is the usual Port number for the OTEL GRPC collector.
- Beyla will guess `http/protobuf` if the port ends in `4318` (`4318`, `14318`, `24318`, ...),
  as `4318` is the usual Port number for the OTEL HTTP collector.

| YAML                   | Environment variable                           | Type | Default |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| `insecure_skip_verify` | `BEYLA_OTEL_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` | bool | `false` |

Controls whether the OTEL client verifies the server's certificate chain and host name.
If set to `true`, the OTEL client accepts any certificate presented by the server
and any host name in that certificate. In this mode, TLS is susceptible to a man-in-the-middle
attacks. This option should be used only for testing and development purposes.

### Sampling policy

Beyla accepts the standard OpenTelemetry environment variables to configure the
sampling ratio of traces.

In addition, you can configure the sampling under the `sampler` YAML subsection of the
`otel_traces_export` section. For example:

```yaml
otel_traces_export:
  sampler:
    name: "traceidratio"
    arg: "0.1"
```

If you are using the Grafana Alloy as your OTEL collector, you can configure the sampling
policy at that level instead.

| YAML   | Environment variable               | Type   | Default                 |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------ | ----------------------- |
| `name` | `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER` | string | `parentbased_always_on` |

Specifies the name of the sampler. It accepts the following standard sampler
names from the [OpenTelemetry specification](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/sdk-configuration/general-sdk-configuration/#otel_traces_sampler):

- `always_on`: samples every trace. Be careful about using this sampler in an
  application with significant traffic: a new trace will be started and exported
  for every request.
- `always_off`: samples no traces.
- `traceidratio`: samples a given fraction of traces (specified by the `arg` property
  that is explained below). The fraction must be a real value between 0 and 1.
  For example, a value of `"0.5"` would sample 50% of the traces.
  Fractions >= 1 will always sample. Fractions < 0 are treated as zero. To respect the
  parent trace's sampling configuration, the `parentbased_traceidratio` sampler should be used.
- `parentbased_always_on` (default): parent-based version of `always_on` sampler (see
  explanation below).
- `parentbased_always_off`: parent-based version of `always_off` sampler (see
  explanation below).
- `parentbased_traceidratio`: parent-based version of `traceidratio` sampler (see
  explanation below).

Parent-based samplers are composite samplers which behave differently based on the
parent of the traced span. If the span has no parent, the root sampler is used to
make sampling decision. If the span has a parent, the sampling configuration
would depend on the sampling parent.

| YAML  | Environment variable                   | Type   | Default |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `arg` | `OTEL_TRACES_SAMPLER_ARG` | string | (unset) |

Specifies the argument of the selected sampler. Currently, only `traceidratio`
and `parentbased_traceidratio` require an argument.

In YAML, this value MUST be provided as a string, so even if the value
is numeric, make sure that it is enclosed between quotes in the YAML file,
(for example, `arg: "0.25"`).

## Filter metrics and traces by attribute values

You might want to restrict the reported metrics and traces to very concrete
event types based on the values of the attributes (for example, filter network
metrics to report only TCP traffic).

The `filter` YAML section allows filtering both application and network metrics
by attribute values. It has the following structure:

```yaml
filter:
  application:
    # map of attribute matches to restrict application metrics
  network:
    # map of attribute matches to restrict network metrics
```

For a list of metrics under the application and network family, as well as their
attributes, check the [Beyla exported metrics]({{< relref "../metrics.md" >}} document.

Each `application` and `network` filter section is a map where each key is an attribute
name (either in Prometheus or OpenTelemetry format), with either the `match` or the `not_match` property. Both properties accept a 
[glob-like](https://github.com/gobwas/glob) string (it can be a full value or include
wildcards). If the `match` property is set, Beyla only reports the metrics and traces
matching the provided value for that given attribute. The `not_match` property is the
negation of `match`.

The following example reports network metrics for connections targeting the destination port 53, excluding the UDP protocol:

```yaml
filter:
  network:
    transport:
      not_match: UDP
    dst_port:
      match: "53"
```

## Using the Grafana Cloud OTEL endpoint to ingest metrics and traces

You can use the standard OpenTelemetry variables to submit the metrics and
traces to any standard OpenTelemetry endpoint, including Grafana Cloud.

Alternatively, Beyla can be configured to submit OpenTelemetry data to
the Grafana Cloud OTEL endpoint using its own custom variables, allowing an
easier setup of the endpoint and the authentication.

The properties can be defined via environment variables, or under the
`grafana` top-level YAML section, `otlp` subsection. For example:

```yaml
grafana:
  otlp:
    cloud_zone: prod-eu-west-0
    cloud_instance_id: 123456
```

| YAML           | Environment variable                | Type     | Default  |
| -------------- | ---------------------- | -------- | -------- |
| `cloud_submit` | `GRAFANA_CLOUD_SUBMIT` | []string | `traces` |

Accepts a list of strings with the kind of data that will be submitted to the
OTLP endpoint. It accepts `metrics` and/or `traces` as values.

| YAML         | Environment variable              | Type   | Default |
| ------------ | -------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `cloud_zone` | `GRAFANA_CLOUD_ZONE` | string | (unset) |

The cloud zone of your Grafana endpoint. This will be used to compose the
Grafana OTLP URL. For example, if the value is `prod-eu-west-0`, the
used OTLP URL will be `https://otlp-gateway-prod-eu-west-0.grafana.net/otlp`.

If any of the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_METRICS_ENDPOINT`
or `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_TRACES_ENDPOINT` variables are defined, they will
override the destination endpoint, so the `cloud_zone` configuration option
will be ignored.

| YAML                | Environment variable                     | Type   | Default |
| ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `cloud_instance_id` | `GRAFANA_CLOUD_INSTANCE_ID` | string | (unset) |

Your Grafana user name. It is usually a number but it must be set as a
string inside the YAML file.

| YAML            | Environment variable                 | Type   | Default |
| --------------- | ----------------------- | ------ | ------- |
| `cloud_api_key` | `GRAFANA_CLOUD_API_KEY` | string | (unset) |

API key of your Grafana Cloud account.

## Prometheus HTTP endpoint

YAML section `prometheus_export`.

This component opens an HTTP endpoint in the auto-instrumentation tool
that allows any external scraper to pull metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
format. It is enabled if the `port` property is set.

| YAML   | Environment variable                 | Type | Default |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| `port` | `BEYLA_PROMETHEUS_PORT` | int  | (unset) |

Specifies the HTTP port for the Prometheus scrape endpoint. If unset or 0,
no Prometheus endpoint is open.

| YAML   | Environment variable                 | Type   | Default    |
| ------ | ----------------------- | ------ | ---------- |
| `path` | `BEYLA_PROMETHEUS_PATH` | string | `/metrics` |

Specifies the HTTP query path to fetch the list of Prometheus metrics.

| YAML  | Environment variable   | Type     | Default |
|-------|------------------------|----------|---------|
| `ttl` | `BEYLA_PROMETHEUS_TTL` | Duration | `5m`    |

The group of attributes for a metric instance is not reported anymore if the time since
the last update is greater than this Time-To-Leave (TTL) value.

The purpose of this value is to avoid reporting indefinitely finished application instances.

| YAML      | Environment variable | Type   |
| --------- | ------- | ------ |
| `buckets` | (n/a)   | Object |

The `buckets` object allows overriding the bucket boundaries of diverse histograms. See
[Overriding histogram buckets](#overriding-histogram-buckets) section for more details.

| YAML       | Environment variable        | Type            | Default                      |
|------------|-----------------------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| `features` | `BEYLA_PROMETHEUS_FEATURES` | list of strings | `["application", "network"]` |

A list of metric groups that are allowed to be exported. Each group belongs to a different feature
of Beyla: application-level metrics or network metrics.

- If the list contains `application`, the Beyla Prometheus exporter exports application-level metrics;
  but only if the Prometheus `port` property is defined, and Beyla was able to discover any
  process matching the entries in the `discovery` section.
- If the list contains `application_span`, the Beyla Prometheus exporter exports application-level metrics in traces span metrics format;
  but only if the Prometheus `port` property is defined, and Beyla was able to discover any
  process matching the entries in the `discovery` section.
- If the list contains `application_service_graph`, the Beyla Prometheus exporter exports application-level service graph metrics;
  but only if the Prometheus `port` property is defined, and Beyla was able to discover any
  process matching the entries in the `discovery` section.
  For best experience with generating service graph metrics, use a DNS for service discovery and make sure the DNS names match
  the OpenTelemetry service names used in Beyla. In Kubernetes environments, the OpenTelemetry service name set by the service name
  discovery is the best choice for service graph metrics.
- If the list contains `network`, the Beyla Prometheus exporter exports network-level
  metrics; but only if the Prometheus `port` property is defined and the
  [network metrics are enabled]({{< relref "../network" >}}).

Usually you do not need to change this configuration option, unless, for example, a Beyla instance
instruments both network and applications, and you want to disable application-level metrics because
you only care about application traces, but still want Beyla to send network metrics.

## Internal metrics reporter

YAML section `internal_metrics`.

This component reports certain internal metrics about the behavior
of the auto-instrumentation tool. Currently, only [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) export
is supported. It is enabled if the `internal_metrics` section
contains a `prometheus` subsection with the `port` property set.

Example:

```yaml
internal_metrics:
  prometheus:
    port: 6060
    path: /internal/metrics
```

| YAML   | Environment variable                                  | Type | Default |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ---- | ------- |
| `port` | `BEYLA_INTERNAL_METRICS_PROMETHEUS_PORT` | int  | (unset) |

Specifies the HTTP port for the Prometheus scrape endpoint. If unset or 0,
no Prometheus endpoint is open and no metrics are accounted.

Its value can be the same as [`prometheus_export.port`](#prometheus-http-endpoint) (both metric families
share the same HTTP server, though they can be accessed in different paths),
or a different value (two different HTTP servers for the different metric families).

| YAML   | Environment variable                                  | Type   | Default             |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------------- |
| `path` | `BEYLA_INTERNAL_METRICS_PROMETHEUS_PATH` | string | `/internal/metrics` |

Specifies the HTTP query path to fetch the list of Prometheus metrics.
If [`prometheus_export.port`](#prometheus-http-endpoint) and `internal_metrics.prometheus.port` have the
same values, this `internal_metrics.prometheus.path` value can be
different from `prometheus_export.path`, to keep both metric families separated,
or the same (both metric families are listed in the same scrape endpoint).

## YAML file example

```yaml
open_port: 443
service_name: my-instrumented-service
log_level: DEBUG

ebpf:
  wakeup_len: 100

otel_traces_export:
  endpoint: https://otlp-gateway-prod-eu-west-0.grafana.net/otlp

prometheus_export:
  port: 8999
  path: /metrics
```
