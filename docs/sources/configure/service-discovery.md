# Configure Beyla service discovery

The `BEYLA_AUTO_TARGET_EXE` and `BEYLA_OPEN_PORT` are environment variables that make it easier to configure Beyla to instrument a single service or a group of related services.

In some scenarios, Beyla instruments many services. For example, as a [Kubernetes DaemonSet](../../setup/kubernetes/) that instruments all the services in a node. The `discovery` YAML section lets you specify more granular selection criteria for the services Beyla can instrument.

## Discovery services

You can override the service name, namespace, and other configurations per service type.

### Name

Defines a name for the matching instrumented service. Beyla uses it to populate the `service.name` OTEL property and the `service_name` Prometheus property in the exported metrics and traces.

This option is deprecated, as multiple matches for the same `instrument` entry mean multiple services share the same name. Refer to the [override service name and namespace](#override-service-name-and-namespace) section to enable automatic configuration of service name and namespace from diverse metadata sources.

If you don't set this property, Beyla uses the following properties, in order of precedence:

- If Kubernetes is enabled:
  1. The name of the Deployment that runs the instrumented process, if any
  2. The name of the ReplicaSet, DaemonSet, or StatefulSet that runs the instrumented process, if any
  3. The name of the Pod that runs the instrumented process
- If Kubernetes isn't enabled:
  1. The name of the process executable file

If multiple processes match the service selection criteria, the metrics and traces for all the instances might share the same service name. For example, when multiple instrumented processes run under the same Deployment, or have the same executable name. In that case, the reported `instance` attribute lets you differentiate the different instances of the service.

### Namespace

Defines a namespace for the matching instrumented service. If you don't set this property, Beyla uses the Kubernetes namespace of the instrumented process, if available, or leaves it empty if Kubernetes isn't available.

This option is deprecated. Refer to the [overriding service name and namespace](#override-service-name-and-namespace) section to enable automatic configuration of service name and namespace from diverse metadata sources.

This namespace is not a selector for Kubernetes namespaces. Beyla uses its value to set the value of standard telemetry attributes. For example, the [OpenTelemetry `service.namespace` attribute](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/otel/common/attribute-naming/).

### Open ports

Selects the process to instrument by the port it has open (listens to). This property accepts a comma-separated list of ports, for example `80`, and port ranges, for example `8000-8999`. If the executable matches only one of the ports in the list, Beyla considers it a match.

For example, specifying the following property:

```yaml
discovery:
  instrument:
    - open_ports: 80,443,8000-8999
```

Beyla selects any executable that opens port 80, 443, or any of the ports between 8000 and 8999 included.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

If an executable opens multiple ports, you only need to specify one of those ports for Beyla to instrument all the HTTP/S and GRPC requests on all application ports. Currently, you can't restrict the instrumentation only to the methods exposed through a specific port.

### Executable path

Selects the processes to instrument by their executable name path. This property accepts a glob to match against the full executable command line, including the directory where the executable resides on the file system.

Beyla tries to instrument all the processes with an executable path matching this property. For example, setting `exe_path: *` makes Beyla try to instrument all the executables in the host.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

### Containers only

Selects processes to instrument which are running in an OCI container. To perform this check, Beyla inspects the process network namespace and matches it against its own network namespace. If Beyla doesn't have enough permissions to perform the network namespace inspection, it ignores this option.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

### K8s namespace

This selector property limits the instrumentation to the applications running in the Kubernetes Namespaces with a name matching the provided glob.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

### K8s Pod name

This selector property limits the instrumentation to the applications running in the Kubernetes Pods with a name matching the provided glob.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

### K8s deployment name

This selector property limits the instrumentation to the applications running in the Kubernetes Deployments with a name matching the provided glob.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

### K8s replicaset name

This selector property limits the instrumentation to the applications running in the Kubernetes ReplicaSets with a name matching the provided glob.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

### K8s statefulset name

This selector property limits the instrumentation to the applications running in the Kubernetes StatefulSets with a name matching the provided glob.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

### K8s daemonset name

This selector property limits the instrumentation to the applications running in the Kubernetes DaemonSet with a name matching the provided glob.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

### K8s owner name

This selector property limits the instrumentation to the applications running in the Pods owned by a `Deployment`, `ReplicaSet`, `DaemonSet`, or `StatefulSet` with a name matching the provided glob.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

### K8s Pod labels

This selector property limits the instrumentation to the applications running in the Pods with labels matching the provided value as glob.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

For example:

```yaml
discovery:
  instrument:
    - k8s_namespace: frontend
      k8s_pod_labels:
        instrument: beyla
```

The preceding example discovers all Pods in the `frontend` namespace that have a label `instrument` with a value that matches the glob `beyla`.

### K8s Pod annotations

This selector property limits the instrumentation to the applications running in the Pods with annotations matching the provided value as glob.

If you specify other selectors in the same `instrument` entry, the processes must match all the selector properties.

For example:

```yaml
discovery:
  instrument:
    - k8s_namespace: backend
      k8s_pod_annotations:
        beyla.instrument: "true"
```

The preceding example discovers all Pods in the `backend` namespace that have an annotation `beyla.instrument` with a value that matches the glob `true`.

## Survey mode

In survey mode, Beyla only performs service discovery and detects the programming language of each service, but doesn't instrument any discovered services.

Beyla writes the discovered information from survey mode to a metric called `survey_info`, which uses the same attributes as the `target_info` metric. The Prometheus exporter creates this metric based on the OpenTelemetry metric resource attributes. You can use survey mode to build external automated instrumentation solutions. For example, you can use the `survey_info` metric to list available instrumentation targets and choose which ones to instrument.

Configure the `survey` section exactly like the `instrument` section. For more details, see the [discovery services section](#discovery-services) of this document.

## Exclude services from instrumentation

The `exclude_instrument` section lets you specify selection criteria for excluding services from being instrumented. It follows the same definition format as described in the [discovery services](#discovery-services) section of this document.

This option helps you avoid instrumenting services typically found in observability environments. For example, use this option to exclude instrumenting Prometheus.

## Default exclude services from instrumentation

The `default_exclude_instrument` section disables instrumentation of Beyla itself (self-instrumentation), as well as Grafana Alloy and the OpenTelemetry Collector. 
It also disables instrumentation of various Kubernetes system namespaces to reduce the overall cost of metric generation. The following section contains all excluded
components:
- Excluded services by `exe_path`: `*beyla`, `*alloy`, `*ebpf-instrument`, `*otelcol`, `*otelcol-contrib`, `*otelcol-contrib[!/]*`.
- Excluded services by `k8s_namespace`: `kube-system`, `kube-node-lease`, `local-path-storage`, `grafana-alloy`, `cert-manager`, `monitoring`, 
  `gke-connect`, `gke-gmp-system`, `gke-managed-cim`, `gke-managed-filestorecsi`, `gke-managed-metrics-server`, `gke-managed-system`, `gke-system`, `gke-managed-volumepopulator`,
  `gatekeeper-system`.

Change this option to allow Beyla to instrument itself or some of the other excluded components.

Note: to enable such self-instrumentation, you still need to include them in the `instrument` section, or these components need to be
a part of a encompassing inclusion criteria.

## Skip go specific tracers

The `skip_go_specific_tracers` option disables the detection of Go specifics when the **ebpf** tracer inspects executables to be instrumented. The tracer falls back to using generic instrumentation, which is generally less efficient.

## Exclude otel instrumented services

The `exclude_otel_instrumented_services` option disables Beyla instrumentation of services already instrumented with OpenTelemetry. Since Beyla is often deployed to monitor all services in a Kubernetes cluster, monitoring already instrumented services can lead to duplicate telemetry data, unless you carefully craft the instrumentation selection (or exclusion) criteria. To avoid unnecessary configuration overhead, Beyla monitors for OpenTelemetry SDK calls to publish metrics and traces, and automatically turns off instrumentation of services that publish their own telemetry data. Turn this option off if your application-generated telemetry data doesn't conflict with the Beyla generated metrics and traces.

## Override service name and namespace

If you export instrumentation data via OpenTelemetry or Prometheus, Beyla follows the [service name conventions from the OpenTelemetry operator](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-operator/blob/main/README.md#how-resource-attributes-are-calculated-from-the-pods-metadata) to improve interoperability with other instrumentation solutions.

Beyla uses the following criteria in this order to automatically set the service name and namespace:

1. Resource attributes set via `OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES` and `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` environment variables of the instrumented process or container.
2. In Kubernetes, resource attributes set via the following Pod annotations:
   - `resource.opentelemetry.io/service.name`
   - `resource.opentelemetry.io/service.namespace`
3. In Kubernetes, resource attributes set via the following Pod labels:
   - `app.kubernetes.io/name` sets the service name
   - `app.kubernetes.io/part-of` sets the service namespace
4. In Kubernetes, resource attributes calculated from the Pod owner's metadata, in the following order (according to their availability):
   - `k8s.deployment.name`
   - `k8s.replicaset.name`
   - `k8s.statefulset.name`
   - `k8s.daemonset.name`
   - `k8s.cronjob.name`
   - `k8s.job.name`
   - `k8s.pod.name`
   - `k8s.container.name`
5. The executable name of the instrumented process.

You can override the Kubernetes labels from the previous bullet 3 via configuration.

In YAML:

```yaml
kubernetes:
  resource_labels:
    service.name:
      # gets service name from the first existing Pod label
      - override-svc-name
      - app.kubernetes.io/name
    service.namespace:
      # gets service namespace from the first existing Pod label
      - override-svc-ns
      - app.kubernetes.io/part-of
```

They accept a comma-separated list of annotation and label names.
