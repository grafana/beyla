# Beyla security, permissions, and capabilities

Beyla needs access to various Linux interfaces to instrument applications, such as reading from the `/proc` filesystem, loading eBPF programs, and managing network interface filters. Many of these operations require elevated permissions. The simplest solution is to run Beyla as root, however this might not work well in setups where full root access isnâ€™t ideal. To address this, Beyla is designed to use only the specific Linux kernel capabilities needed for its current configuration.

## Linux kernel capabilities

Linux kernel capabilities are a fine-grained system for controlling access to privileged operations. They allow you to grant specific permissions to processes without giving them full superuser or root access, which helps improve security by adhering to the principle of least privilege. Capabilities split privileges typically associated with root into smaller privileged operations in the kernel.

Capabilities are assigned to processes and executable files. By using tools like `setcap`, administrators can assign specific capabilities to a binary, enabling it to perform only the operations it needs without running as root. For example:

```shell
sudo setcap cap_net_admin,cap_net_raw+ep myprogram
```

This example grants the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` and `CAP_NET_RAW` capabilities to `myprogram`, allowing it to manage network settings without requiring full superuser privileges.

By carefully choosing and assigning capabilities you can lower the risk of privilege escalation while still letting processes do what they need to.

More information can be found in the [capabilities manual page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html).

## Beyla operation modes

Beyla can operate in two distinct modes: *application observability* and *network observability*. These modes are not mutually exclusive and can be used together as needed. For more details on enabling these modes, refer to the [configuration documentation](/docs/beyla/latest/configure/options/).

Beyla reads its configuration and checks for the required capabilities, if any are missing it displays a warning, for example:

```shell
time=2025-01-27T17:21:20.197-06:00 level=WARN msg="Required system capabilities not present, Beyla may malfunction" error="the following capabilities are required: CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH, CAP_BPF, CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE"
```

Beyla then attempts to continue running, but missing capabilities may lead to errors later on.

You can set `BEYLA_ENFORCE_SYS_CAPS=1`, which causes Beyla to fail immediately if the required capabilities are not available.

## List of capabilities required by Beyla

Beyla requires the following list of capabilities for its functionality:

| Capability               | Usage in Beyla                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CAP_BPF`                | Enables general BPF functionality and socket filter (`BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_FILTER`) programs, used for capturing network flows in *network observability mode*.                                                                     |
| `CAP_NET_RAW`            | Used to create `AF_PACKET` raw sockets, which is the mechanism used to attach socket filter programs used for capturing network flows in *network observability mode*.                                                            |
| `CAP_NET_ADMIN`          | Required to load `BPF_PROG_TYPE_SCHED_CLS` TC programs - these programs are used for capturing network flows and for trace context propagation, both for *network and application observability*.                                 |
| `CAP_PERFMON`            | Used for trace context propagation, general *application observability* and network flow monitoring. Allows direct packet access by TC programs, loading eBPF probes in the kernel and pointer arithmetic used by these programs. |
| `CAP_DAC_READ_SEARCH`    | Access to `/proc/self/mem` to determine kernel version, used by Beyla to determine the appropriate set of supported features to enable.                                                                                           |
| `CAP_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE` | Access to symlinks in the `/proc` filesystem, used by Beyla to obtain various process and system information.                                                                                                                     |
| `CAP_SYS_PTRACE`         | Access to `/proc/pid/exe` and executable modules, used by Beyla to scan executable symbols and instrument different parts of a program.                                                                                           |
| `CAP_SYS_RESOURCE`       | Increase the amount of locked memory available, **kernels < 5.11** only                                                                                                                                                           |
| `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`          | Library-level Go trace-context propagation via `bpf_probe_write_user()` and access to BTF data by the BPF metrics exporter                                                                                                        |

### Performance monitoring tasks

Access to `CAP_PERFMON` is subject to `perf_events` access controls governed by the `kernel.perf_event_paranoid` kernel setting, which can adjusted via `sysctl` or by modifying the file `/proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_paranoid`. The default setting for `kernel.perf_event_paranoid` is typically `2`, which is documented under the `perf_event_paranoid` section in the [kernel documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt) and more comprehensively under [the perf-security documentation](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/admin-guide/perf-security.rst).

Some Linux distributions define higher levels for `kernel.perf_event_paranoid`, for example Debian based distributions [also use](https://lwn.net/Articles/696216/) `kernel.perf_event_paranoid=3`, which disallows access to `perf_event_open()` without `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`. If you are running on a distribution with `kernel.perf_event_paranoid` setting higher than `2`, you can either modify your configuration to lower it to `2` or use `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` instead of `CAP_PERFMON`.

### Deploy on AKS/EKS

Both AKS and EKS environments come with kernels that by default set `sys.perf_event_paranoid > 1`, which means Beyla needs `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` to work, refer to the section on how to [monitor task performance](#performance-monitoring-tasks) for further information. 

If you prefer to use just `CAP_PERFMON`, you can configure your node to set `kernel.perf_event_paranoid = 1`. We've provided a few examples of how to do this, keep in mind that your results may vary depending on your specific setup.

#### AKS

**Create a configuration file**

```json
{
  "sysctls": {
    "kernel.sys_paranoid": "1"
  }
}
```

**Create or update your AKS cluster**

```sh
az aks create --name myAKSCluster --resource-group myResourceGroup --linux-os-config ./linuxosconfig.json
```

For more information, see "[Customize node configuration for Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node pools](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/custom-node-configuration?tabs=linux-node-pools)"
#### EKS (using EKS Anywhere Configuration)

**Create a configuration file**

```yaml
apiVersion: anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/v1alpha1
kind: VSphereMachineConfig
metadata:
  name: machine-config
spec:
  hostOSConfiguration:
    kernel:
      sysctlSettings:
        kernel.sys_paranoid: "1"
```

**Deploy or update your EKS Anywhere cluster**

```sh
eksctl create cluster --config-file hostosconfig.yaml
```

#### EKS (modifying node group settings)

**Update the node group**

```yaml
apiVersion: eks.eks.amazonaws.com/v1beta1
kind: ClusterConfig
...
nodeGroups:
  - ...
    os: Bottlerocket
    eksconfig:
      ...
      sysctls:
        kernel.sys_paranoid: "1"
```

Use the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or eksctl to apply the updated configuration to your EKS cluster.

For more information refer to the [EKS host OS configuration documentation](https://anywhere.eks.amazonaws.com/docs/getting-started/optional/hostosconfig/).

A tracer may load and use different kinds of eBPF programs, each requiring their own set of capabilities.
