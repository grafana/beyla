# Set up Beyla

There are different options to set up and run Beyla:

1. [With Docker to instrument a process running in a container]({{< relref "./docker.md" >}}).
1. [As a Kubernetes DaemonSet using Helm]({{< relref "./kubernetes-helm.md" >}})
1. [As a Kubernetes DaemonSet the Grafana Alloy Helm chart]({{< relref "./helm-alloy.md" >}})
1. [As a Kubernetes DaemonSet or as a sidecar container (manual process)]({{< relref "./kubernetes.md" >}})

For information on configuration options and data export modes, see the [Configure Beyla]({{< relref "../configure/_index.md" >}}) documentation.

You can run Beyla as a standalone process. This approach is suitable for running with bare metal installations, in virtual machines, for local development, or advanced use cases. Consult the documentation in the [Git repository](https://github.com/grafana/beyla/blob/main/docs/sources/setup/standalone.md) to learn how to set up Beyla as a standalone process.

**Note**: If you will be using Beyla to generate traces, please make sure you've read our documentation section on configuring
the [Routes Decorator]({{< relref "../configure/options#routes-decorator" >}}). Since Beyla is auto-instrumenting your application without any
special language level support, configuring the low cardinality routes decorator is very important for optimal results.
