## Deploying Beyla from helm

First, you need to add the Grafana helm repository to Helm:

```sh
helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
```

The following command deploys a Beyla DaemonSet with a default configuration in the `beyla` namespace:

```sh
helm install beyla -n beyla --create-namespace  grafana/beyla
```

The default Beyla configuration:

- exports the metrics as Prometheus metrics in the Pod HTTP port `9090`, `/metrics` path.
- tries to instrument all the applications in your cluster.
- only provides application-level metrics and excludes [network-level metrics]({{< relref "../network" >}}) by default
- configures Beyla to decorate the metrics with Kubernetes metadata labels, for example `k8s.namespace.name` or `k8s.pod.name`

## Configuring Beyla

You might want to override the default configuration of Beyla. For example, to export the metrics and/or spans
as OpenTelemetry instead of Prometheus, or to restrict the number of services to instrument.

You can override the default [Beyla configuration options]({{< relref "../configure" >}}) with your own values.

For example, create a `helm-beyla.yml` file with a custom configuration:

```yaml
config:
  data:
    # Contents of the actual Beyla configuration file
    discovery:
      services:
        - k8s_namespace: demo
        - k8s_namespace: blog
    routes:
      unmatched: heuristic
```

The `config.data` section contains a Beyla configuration file, documented in the
[Beyla configuration options documentation]({{< relref "../configure/options.md" >}}).

Then pass the overridden configuration to the `helm` command with the `-f` flag. For example:

```sh
helm install beyla grafana/beyla -f helm-beyla.yml
```

or, if the Beyla chart was previously deployed:

```sh
helm upgrade beyla grafana/beyla -f helm-beyla.yml
```

## Configuring Beyla metadata

If Beyla exports the data using the Prometheus exporter, you might need to override the Beyla Pod
annotations to let it be discoverable by your Prometheus scraper. You can add the following
section to the example `helm-beyla.yml` file:

```yaml
podAnnotations:
  prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
  prometheus.io/path: "/metrics"
  prometheus.io/port: "9090"
```

Analogously, the Helm chart allows overriding names, labels, and annotations for
multiple resources involved in the deployment of Beyla, such as service
accounts, cluster roles, security contexts, etc. The
[Beyla Helm chart documentation](https://github.com/grafana/beyla/blob/main/charts/beyla/README.md)
describes the diverse configuration options.

## Providing secrets to the Helm configuration

If you are submitting directly the metrics and traces to Grafana Cloud via the
OpenTelemetry Endpoint, you need to provide the credentials via the
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS` environment variable.

The recommended way is to store such value in a Kubernetes Secret and then
specify the environment variable referring to it from the Helm configuration.

For example, deploy the following secret:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: grafana-secret
type: Opaque
stringData:
  otlp-headers: "Authorization=Basic ...."
```

Then refer to it from the `helm-config.yml` file via the `envValueFrom` section:

```yaml
env:
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "<...your Grafana Cloud OTLP endpoint URL...>"
envValueFrom:
  OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS:
    secretKeyRef:
      key: otlp-headers
      name: grafana-secret
```
