# Beyla and Kubernetes walkthrough

Kubernetes is fully integrated into the Beyla operation mode.

On one side, metrics and traces can be decorated
with the metadata of the kubernetes entities running the automatically instrumented
services.

On the other side, DaemonSet has become the preferred deployment
mode for Beyla: thanks to the versatility of the new service selectors,
a user can precisely define which services need to be instrumented and which
don't. A single instance of Beyla will be able to instrument the selected
group of services within a single Kubernetes node.

## Beyla service selectors

A service selector is a set of properties that let Beyla to query which processes need
to be instrumented.

When Beyla is deployed as a regular operating system process that instrument other processes,
the unique service selectors are the network port where the instrumented process should
be listening to (can be specified with the `BEYLA_OPEN_PORT` environment variable) or
a regular expression to match against the executable file name of the process to
instrument (`BEYLA_EXECUTABLE_NAME` environment variable).

To select multiple groups of processes, the Beyla YAML configuration file format
provides a `discovery.services` section that accepts multiple selector groups:

```yaml
discovery:
  services:
    # Instrument any process using the ports from 8080 to 8089
    - open_ports: 8080-8089
    # Instrument any process whose executable contains "http"
    - exe_path: "http"
    # Instrument any process with an executable containing "nginx"
    # and using the port 443 (both conditions must be fulfilled)
    - open_ports: 443
      exe_path: "nginx"
```

The above criteria are insufficient for Kubernetes pods where the ports are ephemeral
and internal to the pods. Also, pods are a level of abstraction that should hide
details such as the name of their executables.
For that reason, Beyla v1.2 introduces the new Kubernetes service
selection criteria. All of them accept a [Go RE2-syntax regular expression](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax)
as value:

- `k8s_namespace`: only instrument applications in the
  namespace matching the provided regular expression.
- `k8s_deployment_name`: only instrument Pods that belong to
  a Deployment with a name matching the provided regular expression.
- `k8s_replicaset_name`: only instrument Pods that belong to
  a ReplicaSet with a name matching the provided regular expression.
- `k8s_pod_name`: only instrument Pods with a name matching the provided regular expression.

## Example scenario

### 1. Deploy testing instrumentable services

You can instrument any HTTP or HTTPS service in your Kubernetes cluster. If you prefer, you
can first try instrumenting the dummy services provided in this example.

The following Kubernetes example file contains two Apache HTTP servers: one pretends to be
a company `website` and the other pretends to be a documentation site (`docs`).
Let's ignore that both servers will just return an "It Works!" string when the root directory
is requested and a 404 error if any other path is requested.

Copy the following contents into a file (for example, `sampleapps.yml`) and deploy it with
the command `kubectl apply -f sampleapps.yml`.

```yaml
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: docs
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: docs
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: docs
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: docs-server
          image: httpd:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
              name: http
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: docs
spec:
  selector:
    app: docs
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
---
kind: Deployment
apiVersion: apps/v1
metadata:
  name: website
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: website
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: website
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: website-server
          image: httpd:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
              protocol: TCP
              name: http
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: website
spec:
  selector:
    app: website
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

To test that they are up and running, open two terminal sessions and run one of
each command below on a different session:

```
# Redirect website to local port 8080
kubectl port-forward services/website 8080:80

# Redirect docs site to local port 8081
kubectl port-forward services/docs 8081:80
```

From your computer, each request to `http://localhost:8080` will be a
hypothetical request to the company website and each request to `http://localhost:8081`
will be a hypothetical request to the documentation website.

### 2. Create `beyla` namespace

Before configuring and deploying Beyla, let's create a `beyla` namespace.
We will group there all the permissions, configurations and deployments
related to it:

```
kubectl create namespace beyla
```

### 3. Get Grafana Cloud credentials

Beyla can export metrics and traces to any OpenTelemetry endpoint, as well as exposing metrics as a Prometheus endpoint. However, we recommend using the OpenTelemetry endpoint in Grafana Cloud. You can get a [Free Grafana Cloud Account at Grafana's website](/pricing/).

From the Grafana Cloud Portal, look for the **OpenTelemetry** box and click **Configure**.

![OpenTelemetry Grafana Cloud portal](https://grafana.com/media/docs/grafana-cloud/beyla/quickstart/otel-cloud-portal-box.png)

Under **Password / API token** click **Generate now** and follow the instructions to create a default API token.

The **Environment Variables** will be populated with a set of standard OpenTelemetry environment variables which will provide the connection endpoint and credentials information for Beyla.

![OTLP connection headers](https://grafana.com/media/docs/grafana-cloud/beyla/quickstart/otlp-connection-headers.png)

From the **Environment Variables** section, copy the `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`
values and create a new secret from them. For example, create the following secret file and apply it:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  namespace: beyla
  name: grafana-credentials
type: Opaque
stringData:
  otlp-endpoint: "https://otlp-gateway-prod-eu-west-0.grafana.net/otlp"
  otlp-headers: "Authorization=Basic ...rest of the secret header value..."
```

### 3. Configure and run Beyla

Next, you need to provide Beyla with permissions to watch and inspect the metadata of the
diverse Kubernetes resources that Beyla's discovery mechanism requires. You must create
the following YAML file and apply it:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  namespace: beyla
  name: beyla
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: beyla
rules:
  - apiGroups: ["apps"]
    resources: ["replicasets"]
    verbs: ["list", "watch"]
  - apiGroups: [""]
    resources: ["pods"]
    verbs: ["list", "watch"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: beyla
subjects:
  - kind: ServiceAccount
    name: beyla
    namespace: beyla
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: beyla
```

And now, deploy Beyla by creating the following Kubernetes entities:

- A `ConfigMap` storing the `beyla-config.yml` Beyla configuration file, which defines
  the service discovery criteria. To verify that Beyla is able to discriminate
  by service instance even if they run the same image and executable,
  Beyla is configured to select ONLY the `docs` Apache web server.
- A Beyla `DaemonSet` providing the Beyla pod and its configuration:
  - Loads the `beyla-config.yml` file from the `ConfigMap`, as specified in the `BEYLA_CONFIG_PATH`
    environment variable.
  - References to the `grafana-secrets` values for the endpoint and credentials.
  - Uses the `beyla` `ServiceAccount` to get all the permissions.

Copy and deploy the following YAML file:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  namespace: beyla
  name: beyla-config
data:
  beyla-config.yml: |
    # this is required to enable kubernetes discovery and metadata
    attributes:
      kubernetes:
        enable: true
    # this will provide automatic routes report while minimizing cardinality
    routes:
      unmatched: heuristic
    # let's instrument only the docs server
    discovery:
      services:
        - k8s_deployment_name: "^docs$"
        # uncomment the following line to also instrument the website server
        # - k8s_deployment_name: "^website$"
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  namespace: beyla
  name: beyla
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      instrumentation: beyla
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        instrumentation: beyla
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: beyla
      hostPID: true # mandatory!
      containers:
        - name: beyla
          image: grafana/beyla:latest
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          securityContext:
            privileged: true # mandatory!
            readOnlyRootFilesystem: true
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /config
              name: beyla-config
            - mountPath: /var/run/beyla
              name: var-run-beyla
          env:
            - name: BEYLA_CONFIG_PATH
              value: "/config/beyla-config.yml"
            - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: grafana-credentials
                  key: otlp-endpoint
            - name: OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: grafana-credentials
                  key: otlp-headers
      volumes:
        - name: beyla-config
          configMap:
            name: beyla-config
        - name: var-run-beyla
          emptyDir: {}
```

Also notice:

- To run in DaemonSet mode, Beyla requires to have access to all the
  processes in the node. Then the Beyla Pod requires to run with `hostPID: true`.
- The Beyla container needs to run with `privileged: true`, as it requires
  to perform privileged actions such as loading BPF programs and creating
  BPF maps. For running Beyla as `unprivileged` container, i.e. without the
  `privileged: true` option, visit the
  [Deploy Beyla unprivileged]({{< relref "../setup/kubernetes.md#deploy-beyla-unprivileged" >}})
  guide.

### 4. Test your instrumented services and see the results in Grafana

With the `kubectl port-forward` commands from the firs step still running,
test both web server instances. For example:

```
curl http://localhost:8080
curl http://localhost:8080/foo
curl http://localhost:8081
curl http://localhost:8081/foo
```

Some requests will return 404 error, but it's OK because they are also instrumented.

Now, go to the instance in Grafana Cloud, and from the **Explore** section in the left panel, select the data source for the traces (usually named `grafanacloud-<your user name>-traces`).

![Select the traces data source](https://grafana.com/media/docs/grafana-cloud/beyla/tutorial/k8s/select-traces.png)

To search for all the traces, select the **Search** box in the Query bar, leave the form empty, and click **Run query**:

![Searching for all the traces in the system](https://grafana.com/media/docs/grafana-cloud/beyla/tutorial/k8s/run-query.png)

This will show the traces for the `docs` instance (port 8081). You might see traces from your own services, but shouldn't see traces from the `website` service, as it has not been instrumented by Beyla.

![Grafana Cloud list of traces](https://grafana.com/media/docs/grafana-cloud/beyla/tutorial/k8s/tut-traces-list.png)

In the trace details, the resource attributes of the traces are decorated with the metadata of the Kubernetes Pod running the instrumented service:
