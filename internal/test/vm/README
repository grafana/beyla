VIRTUAL MACHINE TESTS
=====================

Virtual Machine Tests (VM tests) enables Beyla to be tested under different
kernel versions and architectures. This works by exposing the path to the
Beyla source code (i.e. this git repository) to the guest by means of mounting
it to the '/build' directory. This allows Makefile targets to be invoked from
within the guest, in particular those tied to integration tests. Analogous to
a Docker container, changes to the '/build' directory are volatile and are
neither reflected on the host nor preserved once the VM terminates.

The supported pre-compiled kernels can be found in the 'kernels/$arch/'
subdirectory, alongside their respective kernel config files.

USAGE
=====

Simply run 'make' to get started. This will build a new rootfs image and
launch the VM using the default kernel specified in the Makefile. To select a
different kernel version. The following environment variables can be used to
specify the kernel version or architecture to run:

  - ARCH: the target architecture (currently only x86_64 is supported)

  - KERNEL_VER: the kernel version to use OR;

  - KERNEL: path the kernel image to use

  - TARGET_TEST: the target to pass to Beyla's toplevel Makefile (defaults to
    run-integration-test-vm). When set to empty, the VM will drop onto an
    interactive shell

For debugging purposes, the VM also exposes an SSH endpoint at port 2222. The
access credentials are 'root:root'.

EXAMPLES
========

Running tests against kernel 6.10.6

    KERNEL_VER=6.10.6 make

Running tests against a custom kernel

    KERNEL=/tmp/bzImage make

Running tests against kernel 6.10.6 invoking a custom target

    TARGET_TEST=test KERNEL_VER=6.10.6 make

Running an interactive shell

    TARGET_TEST= make

ADDING A NEW KERNEL VERSION
===========================

In order to add a new kernel version, you will need to download the
corresponding sources from https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/ and
configure it accordingly. Each kernel version requires slightly different
config flags to be set. All kernel features should be compiled as part of the
kernel - the VM DOES NOT support kernel modules at this time.

In order to test whether your newly compiled kernel works, simply run

    KERNEL=path/linux-x.x.x/arch/<arch>/boot/bzImage make

After verifying the kernel works, copy its '.config' file to
'kernels/<arch>/linux-x.y.z.config' and the resulting 'bzImage' to
'kernels/<arch>/vmlinuz-linux-x.y.z'.


TECHNICAL NOTES
===============

    - The VM relies on an Alpine root filesystem containing the minimal
      dependencies to run the 'run-integration-test-vm' target.

    - The Beyla sources are mounted using an 9p filesystem to /beyla

    - For backwards compatibility, $BEYLA_REPO_ROOT/testoutput is mounted
      using an 9p filesystem to /overlay/upper/testoutput - as such, the test
      outputs are available back to the host in the respective directory

    - The final work directory from which tests are run is an overlay of
      /beyla and /overlay/upper mounted using overlayfs to /build
