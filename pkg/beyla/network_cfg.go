	// If the AgentIP configuration property is set, this property has no effect.
	AgentIPIface string `env:"BEYLA_NETWORK_AGENT_IP_IFACE" envDefault:"external"`

	// Interfaces contains the interface names from where flows will be collected. If empty, the agent
	// will fetch all the interfaces in the system, excepting the ones listed in ExcludeInterfaces.

	// ListenInterfaces specifies the mechanism used by the agent to listen for added or removed
	// network interfaces. Accepted values are "watch" (default) or "poll".
