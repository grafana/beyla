# OpenTelemetry Http Instrumentation

The HTTPX instrumentation is a community-maintained instrumentation for the [HTTPX][httpx-home] gem.

## How do I get started?

Install the gem using:

```console
gem install opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx
```

Or, if you use [bundler][bundler-home], include `opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx` in your `Gemfile`.

## Usage

To use the instrumentation, call `use` with the name of the instrumentation:

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use 'OpenTelemetry::Instrumentation::HTTPX'
end
```

Alternatively, you can also call `use_all` to install all the available instrumentation.

```ruby
OpenTelemetry::SDK.configure do |c|
  c.use_all
end
```

## How can I get involved?

The `opentelemetry-instrumentation-httpx` gem source is [on github][repo-github], along with related gems including `opentelemetry-api` and `opentelemetry-sdk`.

## HTTP semantic convention stability

This instrumentation by default emits the stable HTTP semantic conventions. The `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN` environment variable can be used to opt-in to the old or duplicate (both old and stable) semantic conventions.

When setting the value for `OTEL_SEMCONV_STABILITY_OPT_IN`, you can specify which conventions you wish to adopt:

- `http` - Emits the stable HTTP and networking conventions.
- `http/dup` - **DEPRECATED: Will be removed on April 15, 2026.** Emits both the old and stable HTTP and networking conventions.
- `old` - **DEPRECATED: Will be removed on April 15, 2026.** Emits the old HTTP and networking conventions.

For additional information on migration, please refer to our [documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/specs/semconv/non-normative/http-migration/).
